# Distributed-Registry-Service-System
In this project,we implement a distributed registry service system,in which the clients can use the services provided by the multiple remote servers.The whole system consist of three module:Central Registry and Load Balancer,Server,Client.Central registry stores a list of services along with the server IPs that provide those services.Each new server that wants to provide a new service must first register its service with the registry by specifying name of the service, Arguments required for the service along with their types,return type of the service.Each client when trying to invoke a remote procedure on a distant server must first check with the registry for the server that provides the said service. After receiving the server IP and the service procedure signature from the registry corresponding to the required service, the client sends a port request to the specified server to get the port no. on the server on which the service is exposed and the entire service will be executed on this port. Load balancer which depending upon the number of services currently running on any server, splits the load on different servers providing same service.The server will constantly check if a large no. of requests (greater than a specified threshold) come from the same client in a particular window time, then the requests can be throttled to ensure the security and prevent DOS attacks,so in this way our system is much secure.
